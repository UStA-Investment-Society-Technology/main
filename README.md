# Investment Society - Technology Repo #
This repo contains educational content, intended to be utilised by memebers to learn about coding in Python with a financial focus. It was created and is maintained by John Belcher-Heath (**jbh6@st-andrews.ac.uk**), Aayaan Ilyas (**ai49@st-andrews.ac.uk**) and Oliver LÃ¶thgren(**ol31@st-andrews.ac.uk**). Every file in this repo will contain the author to aid finding support - for general enquiries email John.

In regards to layout, there is 4 sections for content, within these sections there will be:
- Jupyter Notebooks:
    - Primary part of the educational material 
    - Contains detailed notes to help follow the code
    - Examples of how each new piece of code learnt can be applied.
- sections_summary.md:
    - Explains what each section contains.
- Python example script:
    - A complete working script which shows how code can be deployed.
    - Fully annotated and conforms to [PEP 8 styling](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- environment.yml file:
    - A conda environment which helps to setup mahcine correctly to run scripts
    - See *misc* to find installation details.
# Contents #
- python_intro_docs (maintained by Aayaan) - Contains basic concepts in Python and starts to introduce you to packages such as Pandas and Numpy. Understanding these fundementals is key to being able to understand and develop advanced financial programs. If you are unsure if you need to do this section feel free to look at the *section_summary.md* file
- python_finance_docs (maintained by John) - Builds on what is learnt in the intro docs by starting to use financial data, complete analyis and interprate results. This section will be the main focus for the Tech analyst role within the society. This section will assume a good coding ability.
- python_finance_advanced_docs (maintained by John and Oliver) - This section contains advanced (and mostly R&D based) content which is aimed to provide extension to the standard methods we use. These include the use of Pytorch, Keras and more. 
- misc - Contains setup instructions and other content that does not fit in the previous 3 sections.

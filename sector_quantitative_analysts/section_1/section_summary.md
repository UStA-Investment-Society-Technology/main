# Section 1 #
In this section you will be introduced to [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/), a great package to fetch up-to-date stock information and an abundance of company information. We will explore how to fetch this data and parse it and then building on our previous knowledge of MatplotLib make some basic plots to visualise the data. The yfinance NB is quite short as I intend you to spend some time learning about the information available, and brushing up on your handling of dataframes.
